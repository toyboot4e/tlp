toylisp is a to-be DSL for my game SnowRL.

== Background

I wanted to add scripting support for my game ({snowrl}) and {glsp} looked nice, but it didn't have `:named arg` syntax. Then I suddenly wanted to make my own Lisp: toylisp (`tlp`).

I did {cr} (part II: tree-walk interpreter) in years ago. I made an Emacs package in ELisp ({toy-scheme}), still I know little about Lisp. I'd have to struggle a lot.

== Devlog (initial approach)

This approach was soon abandoned. Compilation passes: source string â†’ AST â†’ bytecode.

=== Lexer (tokenizer)

* Jun 9, 2021
+
I added a WIP lexer (tokenizer) which converts given string (`&str`) into a vector of tokens.
+
** The lexer handles non-streaming input/output for simplicity.
** The lexer handles UTF-8 string as bytes (as `&[u8])`, not as `Iterator<char>` because we're only interested in ASCII characters while lexing.
** Each token slices the source string with `ByteSpan { lo, hi }`.

* Jun 12, 2021
+
Just a note: nice resource from `rustc` dev guide: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/the-parser.html[Lexing and Parsing].

* Jun 17, 2021
+
I parsed `Vec<Token>` into a hierarchy of tokens. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to stick with tokens and source string though; the API is already uncomfortable.

=== Compiler and bytecode virtual machine

* Jun 17, 2021
+
I added a simple VM which can calculate arithmetics. It's a stack-based VM as one in the book ({cr}).
+
I also added a simple compiler, which converts AST to bytecode. Now `(/ (- 64.0 32.0) 2)` evaluates to `16.0`.

== Devlog

I started to learn from {ra}.

=== Setting up frontend

==== CST

I want my ideal lang to be statically typed, and the parser should be IDE-oriented. toylisp is not that language, still it would be great if I can learn from {ra}.

* Jun 21, 2021
+
Accoording to the doc, {ra} converts source file string into a lossless _(concrete) syntax tree_ with {rowan} footnote:[{rowan} was doing aggressive optimization: deduplication of subtree and use of thin pointers. I couldn't do better than that, so I decided to just use {rowan} instead of re-writing it.].
+
I didn't know the notion of CST. It's basically a tree representation of text (syntax), where each element footnote:[element = sub tree (node) or leaf (token)] is tagged with _syntax kind_ s. One good thing about CST is that each element is _homogeneous_ and _untyped_, so we can easily create CST even for invalid source text in toylisp grammer.
+
Today I parsed simple arithmetics into CST with {rowan}. I can't run the code yet (and for a while).

* Jun 25, 2021
+
I added a WIP AST. In context of {rowan}, an AST node is just a wrapper around a CST node with accessor methods; AST node is always backed by a CST node!

==== Language server and syntax highlighting (tree-sitter)

I'll develop both the language and a language server as the same time.

* Jul 1, 2021
+
I'm making a simple language server using {tower-lsp}. It got connected to VSCode:
+
image::devlog/ls-connected.png[]
+
Awesome!
+
Next thing to do was syntax highlighting. But as of today, LS can't provide syntax highlighting footnote:[It was wrong; see Jul 11, 2021].
+
OMG!
+
And every text editor uses different regular expression for highlights. But don't too worry, {tree-sitter} would be the write-once-run-everywhere syntax highlighter. (If not, well I have some contribution chance. I already sent a https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/1220[PR] to {tree-sitter} (CLI part), praise me! ðŸ˜Ž).
+
Today I got WIP syntax highlighting for toylisp on Emacs with tree-sitter:
+
image::devlog/emacs-tree-sitter-hl.png[]
+
E p i c o

* Jul 4, 2021
+
Summon EoF error!
+
image::devlog/ls-eof.png[]
+
There are lots more things to, such as syncing the buffers, but now the front-end development is ready, so many works can directly improve user experience. Let's become a toylisp user!

* Jul 11, 2021
+
I hear _semantic tokens_ of language server can provide syntax highlighting _without_ highlighting by regex. But I could not let `semantic_highlight_full` called somehow. I'll leave it for later day.

* Jul 17, 2021
+
According to the dev guide, {ra} does the following passes: AST â†’ marco-expanded AST (?) â†’ name-resolved IR â†’ type-resolved IR â†’ HIR. While the conversions, RA uses some important patterns: interning, source map pattern and queries. They are (or will be) built around {salsa}.
+
I used to think making my own tool was straight-forward, but {rowan} already changed my mind; there are lightweight wizard's magic that just works as a super nice framework. So I hope {salsa} is so, too.
+
By the way, this is line counts of `rust-analyzer`;

`hir_def` does name resolution (iiuc).

=== salsa-based HIR

{salsa} is an incremental computation framework, written in less than 4000 lines of code.
