== Background

I wanted to add scripting support for my game ({snowrl}) and {glsp} looked nice, but it didn't have `:named arg` syntax. Then I suddenly wanted to make my own Lisp: Toy Lisp (`tlp`).

I did {cr} (part II: tree-walk interpreter) in years ago. I made an Emacs package in ELisp ({toy-scheme}), but I know little about Lisp, so I'll have to struggle a lot.

== Devlog

=== Bytecode virtual machine

* Jun 9, 2021
+
I added a WIP lexer (tokenizer) which converts given string (`&str`) into a vector of tokens.
+
** The lexer handles non-streaming input/output or simplicity.
** The lexer handles UTF-8 string as bytes (as `&[u8]`, not as `&[char]`) because we're only interested in ASCII characters while lexing.

Nice resource from `rustc` dev guide: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/the-parser.html[Lexing and Parsing]

=== TODOs

* Integration in my game?
* `serde`?
